# PWA Builder

This tool is used to create hosted web applications based on a [W3C Web App manifest](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/).

## Installation

````
npm install -g pwabuilder
````

## Documentation

## Command Line Interface

### Usage

````
pwabuilder <website-url> [options]
````
-or-

````
pwabuilder <command> [options]
````

### Options

|  **&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Option&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** | **Description** |
| ----------------- | --------------- |
| `website-url`     | URL of the hosted website. This parameter is not required if a manifest location is specified with the *-m* option |
| `-d, --directory` | **(optional)** Path to the generated project files (default value: current directory) |
| `-s, --shortname` | **(optional)** Application short name. When specified, it overrides the short_name value of the manifest |
| `-l, --loglevel`  | **(optional)** Tracing log level options. Available log levels: _debug,info,warn,error_ (default value: _warn_) |
| `-p, --platforms` | **(optional)** Platforms to generate. Supported platforms: _windows,windows10,android,ios,web_ (default value: all platforms) |
| `-m, --manifest`  | **(optional)** Location of the W3C Web App manifest file (URL or local path). If not specified, the tool looks for a manifest in the site URL. Otherwise, a new manifest will be created pointing to the site URL. |
| `-i, --image`     | **(optional)** Local path to the image file used to generate missing icons in the manifest |
| `-f, --forceManifestFormat`  | **(optional)** Allows to specify the manifest format and skip the automatic detection. Can be used when the manifest contains additional, non-standard members. |
| `-c, --crosswalk` | **(optional)** Enable Crosswalk for Android. Crosswalk is a web runtime that can be used to replace the stock WebView used by Android Cordova apps. Crosswalk is based on Google Chromium with Cordova API support and has better HTML5 feature support compared to the default WebView available in Android. |
| `-w, --webAppToolkit` | **(optional)** Adds the [Web App Toolkit](https://github.com/manifoldjs/Web-App-ToolKit) cordova plugin. The Web App Toolkit is a plugin for creating Windows, Android and iOS apps based on existing web content. It depends on the Hosted Web App Plugin. Used in the right way, it can facilitate the creation of compelling extensions to your web content for users across platforms. |
| `-S, --Sign` | **(deprecated --optional - for _package_ command)** Return a signed package for Windows 10. |
| `-W, --DotWeb` | **(deprecated --optional - for _package_ command)** Generate a .web package for Windows 10. |
| `-a, --AutoPublish` | **(deprecated --optional - for _package_ command)** Auto-publish a package for Windows 10. |

### Commands

| **&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Command&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;** | **Description** |

## Supported Input Manifests

- [W3C Web App](http://www.w3.org/TR/appmanifest/)
- [Chrome Hosted Apps](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps)

We plan to support the following manifest files in the future:

- [Web App Template](http://wat-docs.azurewebsites.net/JsonWindows)
- [Firefox Open Web Apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/Apps/Build/Manifest)

## Navigation Scope

The W3C manifest defines a scope that restricts the URLs to which the application can navigate. PWA Builder supports the scope setting for the Android, iOS and Windows platforms (more details [here](https://github.com/manifoldjs/ManifoldCordova#navigation-scope)).

## Changelog

Releases are documented in [GitHub](https://github.com/manifoldjs/ManifoldJS/releases).

## Known Issues
- Creating the directory shortcuts to the Cordova platform-specific projects may fail when running in the Windows environment. The tool reports **_"WARNING: Failed to create shortcut for Cordova platform: XXXX."__** where **_XXXX_** is **_ios_**, **_windows_**, or **_android_**.
  This is caused by an issue in Node.js which has been fixed in more recent releases. To resolve this issue, upgrade Node.js to the latest version.

- Adding the **windows** platform in the Linux and Mac OS environments fails. The tool reports **_"WARNING: Failed to add the Cordova platforms: XXXX."_** where **_XXXX_** includes **_windows_**.
  This is caused by an issue in the Windows platform for Cordova. Depending on the cordova-windows version, running the tool can show one of two errors: **"_Cannot find module 'Q'."_** or **"_No such file or directory."_**. Until this problem is fixed by Cordova, we've removed the windows platform from the default list when creating the app in Linux or Mac OS.

- Error when building an iOS application for projects generated in a Windows machine and then copied to an OS X machine. Xcode reports "**_Shell Script Invocation Error - Command /bin/sh failed with exit code 126_**". This happens when the execution permission (+x) is lost on some scripts when copying between the different file systems.

  To resolve this, open a Terminal window in OS X and execute the following command to restore the executable bit on the script.
  ```
  chmod +x [path to the PWA Builder project]/cordova/platforms/ios/cordova/lib/copy-www-build-step.sh
  ```

- Issues in Visual Studio 2015 RC with the Windows solution generated by Cordova:
  - Opening the **CordovaApp.sln** solution file might hang Visual Studio while loading the Windows 8 project. As a workaround, remove the Windows 8 project file from the solution.
  - When building the solution, Visual Studio reports the following error in the Windows 10 project: **_"'ValidateAppxManifest' failed. Unspecified error"_**. As a workaround, clean and rebuild the solution.
