### Validate appxmanifest.xml and Assets

The following can be found at the [Windows Store Portal](https://dev.windows.com/) under the "App Identity" section of your application submission.
For more help, follow the instructional video from [PWA Builder](http://manifoldjs.com/).

The appxmanifest.xml can be found in the "Working Directory"/"Extension Name"/edgeextension/manifest folder.

Insert the correct Package Identity Name, Package Identity Publisher, and Version
```
<Identity
